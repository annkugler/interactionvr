<h1 id="connecting-the-meta-quest">Connecting the Meta Quest</h1>

<p>Problem: If connecting the Meta Quest with a Linux machine, the device is not listed on the connected devices.</p>

<p>Solution: Adjusting the android rules to grant permission for the meta quest.</p>

<p>Device USB information:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">Bus 001 Device 017: ID 2833:0182 
</code></pre>

<p>Adding the following line to the android rules file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-console">SUBSYSTEM==&quot;usb&quot;, ATTR{idVendor}==&quot;2833&quot;, ATTR{idProduct}==&quot;0182&quot;, MODE=&quot;0666&quot;, GROUP=&quot;plugdev&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the Meta Quest Device shows up when connecting via and USB-C/ USB cable.</p>

<h1 id="unity-setup-for-meta-quest">Unity Setup for Meta Quest</h1>

<p>Installing the required packages to get the Meta Quest running on a Linux machine with Unity.</p>

<p>Steps that have been performed:</p>

<ul>
<li>custom install of jdk and android sdk tools for linux</li>
<li>installing the latest stable version of Unity with Android Build Support</li>
<li>getting the Oculus Integration SDK Package from the Unity Asset Store</li>
<li>updating OVRPlugin manually after installing XR integration</li>
<li>creating a developer account on the MetaQuest page and setup 2-factor authentification for verification</li>
<li>enable Developer Mode for the device via the Meta Quest App on the mobile phone</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="testing-meta-quest-in-unity">Testing Meta Quest in Unity</h1>

<p>Now, I want to check if I can actually construct a sample scene in Unity and show it on the Meta Quest device.</p>

<p>First of all, I had to locate Unity on the headset by searching for &ldquo;Unknown Sources&rdquo; in the App Managment section.</p>

<p>Then, I openend Unity and selected a random sample scene from the Assets/Oculus/SampleFramework/Usage folder.</p>

<p>I dragged the scene into my Unity project and built the scene with the Oculus headset as selected device, which took a while.</p>

<p>After that, I put on the headset and saw that I was located in an empty Unity scene.</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;ve got some good and some bad news:</p>

<p>1.) I got the Meta Quest connected to Unity (yay!)
2.) But, unfortunately, the scene that was shown was not the same as the sample scene I have selected</p>

<p>Guess, now I have to figure out how to represent the sample scene to be shown on the Meta Quest.</p>
