<p>Over 50 years ago, back in 1965 Ivan E. Sutherland expressed his vision of the <code>Ultimate Display</code> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a
room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be
fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back at the time, the most common input device was still a typewriter keyboard.
In 1963, Ivan E. Sutherland pitched the <em>Sketchpad</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> in MIT&rsquo;s Joint Computer Conference.
This first realization of a computer touchpad introduced the idea that touching directly on the screen has observable consequences on the system.
With this innovation, a whole new way of computer human interaction has started.</p>

<p>Sutherland describes, that the existing joysticks don&rsquo;t have comparable degrees of freedom, so that natural interaction could take place.
But if we could link the controllers with a force that is task-specific it could feel like we are executing the action in real life.</p>

<p>He continues the vision even further in the Ultimate Display, when he imagines the computer to have sensors of our body state.
This includes body muscles, which have at the time already been used for computer control and also eye motion.
Using eye motion as a control mechanism enables control without manual physical interaction with the device.</p>

<p>Ivan E. Sutherland described a room, where some form of computer creates a reality that is indistinguishable from the real world.
His ideas have been formative for the way of thinking of technology and have been taken up by many others.</p>

<p>In 2011 the term <code>Ultimate Display</code> is used again by Steven Bathiche, who is the head of the Applied Sciences Group within Microsoft<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
They have developed a screen, where two people could interact as if the other person was standing on the other side of the screen, while in reality
they are being situated at different places or even a different point of time.
Thereby, not only touch but also the eye position is tracked with a Microsoft Kinect camera.
With a few steps of technology, different video streams are created for the left and right eye.
The result is the illusion of an 3D image, which changes accordingly to moving the body position.
While the application of this techniques for Microsoft devices have not been stated, it could be a possiblity to communicate naturally from different parts of the world,
like from both sides on a glass where both participants can simultaneously interact with the screen from their <em>side of the glass</em>.</p>

<p>While we have found a lot of solutions and technology is constantly improving, I think that we are still distant from the vision of Sutherland.
To focus on the chair example: We would nee a kind of technology, that would, based on interactions with the virutal enviroment, ad-hoc create a chair or a force representing a chair,
so that in real enviroment without chair, we would still be able to sit.</p>
