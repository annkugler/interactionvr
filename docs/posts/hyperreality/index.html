<h2 id="is-it-only-a-vision-in-the-distant-future-or-already-finding-its-way-into-our-everyday-life">Is it only a vision in the distant future or already finding its way into our everyday life?</h2>

<p>If we look back in the early 20th century, people back then never imagined that the technologies, we are using these days will become part of the human life.
While there have been visions about Virtual Reality and technology of people causally interacting with computers, it was still a concept of the distant future.
Up to a few years ago, these technologies were really expensive and not suitable for everyday use but for research purposes only.
But recently, this has been changing.</p>

<p>In September 2020, the VR Headset Oculus Quest 2 was introduced by the Facebook company &ldquo;Meta&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.
The marketing idea, that was present along with it, proposed the vision of an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_bVkbG1ZCo&amp;list=PL0cctlIM1JkeRtMyn0NXC7ovhxDa35svM&amp;index=2"><em>Infinite Office</em></a>.
To wrap it up, the main ideas that were shown in the video were:</p>

<ul>
<li>we can sit down everywhere we want to and put on the headset</li>
<li>with the headset on we can still perceive our real enviroment</li>
<li>on top of it we can project our working space as a virutal desktop</li>
<li>the virtual space integrates other technologies like messages from a smartphone<br /></li>
<li>to naviagte in the virtual working space we can use smart gestures and different support devices from the real world (keypads)</li>
<li>we can also fade out our real surroundings and fully engage in the virtual space</li>
</ul>

<p>Is this already pointing into the direction of Hyperreality? <code>Hyperreality</code> is, by definition</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As it is proposed in the advertisment of Meta, it becomes possible to quickly engange and disengage with a virtual enviroment.
Reality can somehow turned on/ off like a switch, which is why it might become harder for us to perceive what is &ldquo;real&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/517160/Richies_Plank_Experience/">&ldquo;Richie&rsquo;s Plank&rdquo;</a>, where people are waking on a virtual plank on a 80 stories high skyscraper,
they are experiencing real emotions, which can be physiologically measured.
If this is happening within a virtual enviroment, we talk about <code>immersion</code>. The term immersion describes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the perception of beingh physically present in a non-physical world.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Compared to the definition of Hyper Reality, creating an experience of immersion seems to be the necesseray foundation for creating a Hyper Reality.
Therefore, I think, even if the term sounds like a concept of the future, we may not be as far away from it as it seems.</p>
